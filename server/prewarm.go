// prewarm sends a handful of synthetic requests to the freshly started listener
// so the first real client request does not pay the one-time cost of warming the
// whole serving path: accepting a connection, the per-connection read/write
// buffers, route matching, the middleware chain, the JSON encode/decode paths,
// the list-response buffer pool, and growing the GC heap. The cost is paid once
// at startup (where it overlaps nothing the client waits on) instead of on a
// client's first request.
//
// The warm-up requests are intentionally unsigned: the cold cost lives in the
// connection-setup path (accepting the connection, the per-connection buffers,
// reading the request, the middleware chain, and JSON error encoding), all of
// which run before authentication rejects an unsigned request. Skipping the
// signatures keeps startup cheap (no RSA work) while still warming the path that
// matters. None of the requests mutate the store.
