# Developing cinc-zero

Building, testing, the dev fixtures, and running a fully-populated local server
you can point a management console at.

## Build and test

```sh
make build          # compile ./cinc-zero (version metadata via ldflags)
make test           # go test ./... -race -cover (the full suite)
make vet            # go vet ./...
make fmt            # gofmt -w .
```

Always run `make test && make vet` before committing. Development is strict TDD:
write a failing test first.

Authentication golden vectors under `internal/auth/testdata` are generated from
the real `mixlib-authentication` gem via `ruby gen_vectors.rb`, guaranteeing
byte-for-byte compatibility with Chef clients.

## Conformance

A build-tagged suite drives the real **`knife` CLI** (from Cinc Workstation)
against an in-process cinc-zero server, exercising signed reads/writes, search,
and the cookbook sandbox/upload flow:

```sh
make conformance    # needs knife from Cinc Workstation: https://omnitruck.cinc.sh/install.sh
```

It skips automatically when no runnable `knife` is present, and runs in CI
(`.github/workflows/conformance.yml`) after installing Cinc Workstation via
omnitruck.

## Dev fixtures

Two representations of the same realistic dataset live under `dev/`:

- **`dev/test-repo/`** — the canonical, diffable base seed: a full server-state
  directory (the `--state` format) with global users, the `acme` organization,
  ~100 hand-curated nodes, roles, environments, data bags, cookbooks,
  Policyfiles/policy groups, authz groups, and org membership. Source of truth;
  edit it as text.
- **`cmd/seedgen`** — a deterministic generator that produces the *large*
  synthetic expansion of the fictional **ACME** business: ~1000 extra nodes
  across 20 functional tiers (web/app/api/worker/db/cache/queue/search/proxy/
  lb/ci/log/monitor/storage/dns/backup/dc/mail/bastion/vault), named like real
  hosts (`web-iad-014`, `db-fra-003`), plus the roles and cookbooks those nodes
  run, `qa`/`dr` environments, and 25 filler users. It writes a git-ignored
  `dev/seed.gen/` that `make dev-db` bakes on top of the base seed.
- **`dev/cinc-dev.db`** — a SQLite database **committed** as a ready-to-run
  fixture (~1100 nodes, 21 roles, 21 cookbooks, 6 environments, 28 users). It is
  baked from `dev/test-repo` + `cmd/seedgen`; `make run-dev-sqlite` serves it
  directly with no build step.

`make dev-db` bakes the base seed, runs `seedgen`, and bakes the expansion on
top — **additively**, so re-running preserves the existing `pivotal` key (a
console's webui key keeps working) and any runtime data. Use `make dev-db-reset`
for a clean rebuild from scratch (which rotates the key).

```sh
make dev-db          # additive rebuild (key-stable)
make dev-db-reset    # clean rebuild from scratch (rotates the dev key)
```

## Running a dev server

```sh
# In-memory, no auth — fastest for poking at the API with curl/knife. --no-auth
# also turns off ACL enforcement:
make run-dev            # --no-auth --state dev/test-repo --key-out dev-admin.pem

# Durable SQLite with auth AND ACL enforcement on (the binary's defaults) — what a
# management console needs, and how a real Chef Infra Server behaves (builds the DB
# first if missing):
make run-dev-sqlite     # --storage sqlite --db dev/cinc-dev.db --key-out dev-admin.pem
```

Both write the bootstrap admin private key to `./dev-admin.pem`. With the SQLite
backend that key is **stable across restarts** (it's persisted in the database),
so a console configured once keeps working as you stop and start the server.

## Test accounts

The seed ships these credentials (all members of org **`acme`**):

| User      | Password   | Role                                                    |
|-----------|------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| `tim`     | `tim123`   | **Org admin** of `acme` — in its `admins` group, so the console shows full read/write access (and grant). |
| `jack`    | _(none)_   | Regular member of `acme` (in its `users` group): read access, no admin/grant. Has a key but no password, so no console login. |
| `pivotal` | _(none)_   | Bootstrap **superuser** (key-based). Its private key is `dev-admin.pem`. |

Access levels mirror a real Chef Infra Server. `tim` is a full org admin — the
seed equivalent of `chef-server-ctl org-user-add acme tim --admin` (membership
in the org's `admins` group grants every permission on every object). `jack` is
a plain member: the loader adds every `members.json` user to the `users` group
(as `POST /organizations/<org>/users` does), so they inherit the default read
ACL but not admin/grant. Under ACL enforcement a console acts **as the
logged-in user**, so `tim` sees and edits everything while `jack` can browse but
not, e.g., change ACLs.

`pivotal` authenticates with the key in `dev-admin.pem`, not a password. `tim`
can sign in with a password, which is what a console's user login uses:

```sh
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8889/authenticate_user \
  -d '{"username":"tim","password":"tim123"}'
# => {"status":"linked", ...}
```

## Connecting cinc-console

[cinc-console](https://github.com/tas50/cinc-console) (a web management console
for Chef Infra Server) signs requests on a user's behalf using the **webui key**
via the
`X-Ops-Request-Source: web` mechanism, which cinc-zero supports. By default the
webui key **is** the bootstrap admin key, i.e. the `dev-admin.pem` written above —
no extra setup. (To use a distinct key instead, pass `--webui-key <path>`.)

1. Start the durable dev server with auth on:

   ```sh
   make run-dev-sqlite          # listens on http://127.0.0.1:8889 by default
   ```

2. Point the console at the server and give it the webui key:
   - **Chef server URL:** `http://127.0.0.1:8889/organizations/acme`
   - **webui key:** the contents of `./dev-admin.pem`

3. Sign in to the console as a seeded user — **`tim` / `tim123`** — to browse
   the `acme` org's nodes, roles, environments, data bags, cookbooks, and
   Policyfiles, with the server enforcing that user's view.

ACL enforcement is on by default, so the console exercises authorization exactly
as it would against a real Chef Infra Server — answering with `403` where a
production server would. Pass `--enforce-acls=false` if you want a permissive
server where every authenticated actor is allowed.
